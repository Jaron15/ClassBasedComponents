# ClassBasedComponents
This is a simple demo of how to use Class based components as opposed to functional components in React. I replaced the working functional components and their hooks with Class based components and "lifecycle methods" and left some notes explaining how they relate to functional components. The functional components are still in the code, just commented out below the class functions.
